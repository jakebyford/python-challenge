# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

Inside this repo is the Python scripts to compile the Election Data & Budget Data files. 
The scripts compiles through each index analyzing different data series. PyBank uses formulas to surface financial data
while PyPoll takes an overall analysis of a voting poll. Each main file writes their own unique csv file seperate
from the main file while using data given from the data files. To open the analyzed files they are located in their respective analysis folders.
